Styling for Pygments markup

![Colorcode UI](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4285147/1821025/3377d2e8-711b-11e3-887e-aa7a75c7697e.png)

## Plans
The following items are considered high priority
- Provide menu for predefined pygments style
- Provide editors for all of the Pygments classes
- Drag and drop files for styling (this will require a backend to do the pygments processing)
- Output to CSS

Less crucial features
- LESS/SCSS support
    - Define colors at top and use in place of hex codes
    - Output to SCSS/LESS with variables
