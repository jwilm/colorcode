Styling for Pygments markup

## Plans
The following items are considered high priority
- Provide menu for predefined pygments style
- Provide editors for all of the Pygments classes
- Drag and drop files for styling (this will require a backend to do the pygments processing)
- Output to CSS

Less crucial features
- LESS/SCSS support
    - Define colors at top and use in place of hex codes
    - Output to SCSS/LESS with variables
